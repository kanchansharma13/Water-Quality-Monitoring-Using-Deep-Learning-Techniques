The water quality monitoring project begins by setting up the environment, including installing PySpark and importing essential libraries. The dataset is then uploaded into a Spark DataFrame for processing. Initial data cleaning involves removing irrelevant columns and excluding rows with missing values through SQL queries, ensuring the dataset is optimized for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize trends and gain insights from the data. Feature engineering is performed by converting the data into a Pandas DataFrame, which facilitates efficient computation of the water quality index and better visualization. Finally, the project prepares for predictive modeling to analyze water quality.
